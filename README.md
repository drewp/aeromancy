**Aeromancy** is an opinionated philosophy and open-sourced framework that
closely tracks experimental runtime environments for more reproducible machine
learning. In existing experiment trackers, itâ€™s easy to miss important details
about how an experiment was run, e.g., which version of a dataset was used as
input or the exact versions of library dependencies. Missing these details can
make replicability more difficult. Aeromancy aims to make this process smoother
by providing both new infrastructure (a more comprehensive versioning scheme
including both system runtimes and external datasets) and a corresponding set of
best practices to ensure experiments are maximally trackable.

In its current form, Aeromancy requires a fairly specific software stack: (hey,
we said it was opinionated)

- **Experiment tracker**: [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai)
- **Object storage** (artifacts): S3-compatible, e.g.,
  [Ceph](https://github.com/ceph/ceph)
- **Virtualization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- **Python Package Manager**: [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev)
- **Revision Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Note:** As is likely obvious, Aeromancy documentation is in a very early
state. As this is a pre-release support may be limited. For now, we include a
couple pointers for how to setup your environment for Aeromancy.

## Documentation overview

- If you're new to Aeromancy, [start here](docs/docs/quick_start.md)!
- In the Developer Reference section of the documentation, we include some
  design docs which provide an [architectural overview](docs/docs/scaffolding.md) and a
  [glossary](docs/docs/tasks.md) of terms.
- To see autogenerated docs for code from this repo, you'll need to start a
  local doc server (`pdm doc`).

## Common development commands

- `pdm lint`: Run pre-commit linters
- `pdm test`: Run test suite
- `pdm doc`: Start doc server (see also the [public
  version](https://quant-aq.github.io/aeromancy/) for the latest release)
